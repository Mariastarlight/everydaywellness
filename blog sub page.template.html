It contains a good amount of fibre, minerals and vitamins which boost nutrition.<br>

<p>  
This blog post is for the person that wants to be more active but also values simplicity and saving money.<br>
This is about making walking a regular part of your life! With just a few walks per week we believe you can increase your quality of life. <br>
So how to start? Well, we recommend finding a circular route you can complete in about 40 minutes at a brisk pace.<br> 
Try to find an area near nature or in your local park. We believe that the quieter, calmer areas with greenery are the best types of environments to walk in, so do find a pleasant route!<br>
Walk in silence or listen to your favourite podcast; tailor your walk to your preferences and you'll be more likely to stick to it.<br>
Happy walking!</p>

<h3>Yin Yoga for Tranquility and Happiness</h3>
    <h4><i>why we love yin!</i></h4>

    <p>
    If done correctly, Yin Yoga chellenges your patience, improves your meditation skills, and deeply calms the body's nerve system.<br>
    As each yoga pose is held for several minutes, your breathing activates the parasympathetic nerve system in the body which supports the "rest and digest" phase of the internal organs's processes.<br>
    Over time, this brings about a state of feeling more steady, calm and assured in one's body. Also, you may find that you are less easily agitated, and distracted by the world around you. Plainy said, you are more presently <i>you</i>.<br>
    Sign up for a yin yoga class and let us know what you think!</p>

        <h3>The Four Pillars of Fitness are REST</h3>
        <h4><i>an easy reminder on how to stay fit</i></h4>
        
        <img src="acronym%20infografikk.jpg" width="670" height="350"     <br>
        
        <p>We have created an acronym for you, to remind you about everything you should do to stay balanced and fit. REST stands for "recovery, eat well, sunshine, and training". To acheive sustainable health, exercise and nutrition are essential. Regular activity is good for your body and mind and it keeps you fit! Of course you need good fuel in terms of nutrition, so eat whole foods, fibre, and avoid processed sugar. We believe in the power of sunshine, so get outside and restock your vitamin D. Lastly, you must give yourself time to recover! That's why we called this handy acronym REST; take time to sleep, meditate, enjoy tranquility and you will reap the benefits of your efforts even more! </p>
